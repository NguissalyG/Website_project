At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data }

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2)
#UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                #sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                #skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. We are expressing all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$).


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(col=4:51, #pivoting column 4 to 51 of  the UN_GDP_data table to a longer format
               names_to = "Years", #headers of column 4 to 51 now appear in one column as years 
               values_to ="Estimates") #values in columb 4 to 51 now appear in a second column named estimates 


tidy_GDP_data$Estimates = tidy_GDP_data$Estimates/1e9

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("Senegal","Canada", "United Kingdom")


glimpse(country_list)

```


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}


#creating a variable for the indicators so we can filter easily
indicator_list <- c("Gross capital formation",
                    "Exports of goods and services",
                    "General government final consumption expenditure",
                    "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
                    "Imports of goods and services")


GDP_country_list <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% #as there is no variable in the Country column, using == does not work 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% indicator_list)



#Plotting , group and color as indicator to have separated lines
Graph_1 <- GDP_country_list %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= Years,
             y= Estimates,
             group=IndicatorName, 
             color=IndicatorName))+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~Country, scales = "free")+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       x = "",
       y = "Billion US$")+
    scale_x_discrete(breaks =seq(1970,2010,10))+
    
    
   NULL

#Changing the legend
Graph_1 + scale_colour_discrete(name ="Components of GDP",
                      breaks= c("Gross capital formation",
                    "Exports of goods and services",
                    "General government final consumption expenditure",
                    "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
                    "Imports of goods and services"),
                    labels= c("Gross capital formation",
                              "Exports",
                              "Government expenditure",
                              "Household expenditure",
                              "Imports"))+
  
    NULL

  

```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like to calculate it given its components discussed above.



```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#Pivot wider to have every GDP component in a column 
GDP_to_calculate <- GDP_country_list %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName,
              values_from = Estimates) 

#Change column names 
colnames(GDP_to_calculate)[4] <- "Consumption"
colnames(GDP_to_calculate)[5] <- "Government_Expenditure"
colnames(GDP_to_calculate)[6] <- "Gross_capital_formation"
colnames(GDP_to_calculate)[7] <- "Exports"
colnames(GDP_to_calculate)[8] <- "Imports"

# add new columns to calculate net exports, GDP and proportion of the components 
GDP_calculated <- GDP_to_calculate %>% 
  mutate(Net_Exports = Exports- Imports,
         GDP = Consumption + 
           Government_Expenditure +
           Gross_capital_formation + 
           Net_Exports,
         Prop_C=Consumption/GDP,
         Prop_I=Gross_capital_formation/GDP,
         Prop_G=Government_Expenditure/GDP,
         Prop_NE=Net_Exports/GDP)

GDP_calculated


```

```{r, plot new GDP calculation}


#Pivot longer to have all propotions in one column
GDP_calculated_longer <- GDP_calculated %>% 
  select(-c(1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) %>% #deselecting these for columns and will only have 6 left
  pivot_longer(cols= 3:6, #first and second columns will be country and years, we do not want to pivot those
               names_to = "Components_of_GDP",
               values_to = "Proportions_of_GDP")

#Plotting the grap
Graph_2 <- GDP_calculated_longer %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= Years,
             y= Proportions_of_GDP,
             group=Components_of_GDP, 
             color=Components_of_GDP))+

  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars",
