      <description>Born and raised in Dakar, the capital of Senegal,the most western country in Africa and home of the pink lake (pictured above from Dakarlives’ Instagram page). I moved to Montreal, Canada in 2015 to pursue my undergrad in Business Administration with a focus in Finance at HEC Montreal.
While at HEC, I had the opportunity to live for sixth months in Glasgow as part of an International Exchange Program. I loved the experience as it enabled me to discover new cultures, travel and more importantly visit London, the city of my heart.</description>

      <description>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the Wikipedia GDP page.
The GDP data I will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>

      <description>Introduction to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) A fundamental idea in finance is that investors need financial incentives to take on risk. Thus, the expected return R on a risky investment, e.g., a stock, should exceed the risk-free return Rf, or the excess return (R - Rf) should be positive. Typically, for risk-free rate we use short-term government bonds, like the US 3-month treasury bills https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIRX?p=^IRX
The Capital Asset Market Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the return on a particular risky asset is related to returns of the ‘market’ as follows:</description>

      <description>General Social Survey (GSS) The General Social Survey (GSS) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.
Here, I analyze data from the 2016 GSS sample data, using it to estimate values of population parameters of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but I am only interested in very few of these variables and thus, I am using a smaller file.</description>
