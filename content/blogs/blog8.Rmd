# Introduction to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

A fundamental idea in finance is that investors need financial incentives to take on risk. Thus, the expected return R on a risky investment, e.g., a stock, should exceed the risk-free return Rf, or the excess return (R - Rf) should be positive. Typically, for risk-free rate we use short-term government bonds, like the US 3-month treasury bills https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIRX?p=^IRX
 

The Capital Asset Market Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the return on a particular risky asset is related to returns of the 'market' as follows: 

   $Return(asset) = \alpha + \beta*Return(market)+error$
   
   
The $\alpha$ is the "excess return" of a stock. According to the CAPM, this "excess return" is the reward for taking on the "specific risk" of the stock. As this risk can be eliminated through holding a diversified portfolio, CAPM says the excess return should be close to zero.

The $\beta$ is a measure of the "market risk" of a stock. It is an indication of how sensitive the stock is to movements in the market as a whole; for a 1% market movement, $\beta=1$ implies the stock tends to move 1%, $\beta<1$ means the stock tends to move by less than 1%,  whereas $\beta>1$ means the stock tends to move more than 1%, or it 'exaggerates' market movements.

Here, I will run linear regressions to estimate the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of a couple of stocks, as well as their specific risk. I will use the `tidyquant package to download historical prices off the internet and will also see some R code that allow me to calculate a rolling beta. I will explore the relationship between returns (%) of the market (SPY, an ETF that tracks the S&P500) and for a number of stocks, namely WalMart (ticker symbol: WMT),  JPMorgan (JPM), Burberry Group plc (BURBY), LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (LVMHF), and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK). 



## Loading the data

The `tidyquant` package comes with a number of functions- utlities that allow me to download financial data off the web, as well as ways of handling all this data. 

I begin by loading the data set into the R workspace. We create a collection of stocks with their ticker symbols and then use the _piping_ operator _%>%_ to use tidyquant's `tq_get` to download historical data from Jan 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2017 using Yahoo finance and, again, to group data by their ticker symbol.

```{r load-data, cache=TRUE}
myStocks <- c("WMT","JPM","BURBY","LVMHF","BLK","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2017-08-01",
         to   = "2020-09-30") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

str(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

For each ticker symbol, the data frame contains its `symbol`, the `date`, the prices for `open`,`high`, `low` and `close`, and the `volume`, or how many stocks were traded on that day. More importantly, the data frame contains the `adjusted` closing price, which adjusts for any stock splits and/or dividends paid and this is what we will be using for our analyses.

Towards the end, you can see a line `- attr(*, "group_sizes")= int  1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761 1761`.
Since I grouped the data by its ticker symbol, I can see that over the course of 7 years (2011-2017) we have 1761 trading days, or roughly 250 trading days per year. 

Financial performance and CAPM analysis depend on __returns__ and not on __adjusted closing prices__. So given the adjusted closing prices, the firststep is to calculate daily and monthly returns. 

```{r calculate_returns,include=FALSE}

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly.returns") 

#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily.returns")  
```


For yearly and monthly data, I assume discrete changes, so the formula used to calculate the return for month __(t+1)__ is 

$Return(t+1)= \frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}-1$

For daily data we use log returns,  or $Return(t+1)= LN\frac{Adj.Close(t+1)}{Adj.Close (t)}$

The reason I use log returns are:

a.	Compound interest interpretation; namely, that the log return can be interpreted as the continuously (rather than discretely) compounded rate of return

b.	Log returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution

c.	Log return over n periods is the sum of n log returns

I am curious to see what my investments would have grown to, of we had invested $1000 in each of the assets  on Aug 1, 2017. 

```{r wealth_index, echo=FALSE}
#calculate 'daily'wealth' returns, or what a 100 investment will grow to 
cumulative_wealth <- myStocks_returns_daily %>%
  mutate(wealth.index = 1000 * cumprod(1 + daily.returns))


ggplot(cumulative_wealth, aes(x=date, y = wealth.index))+
  geom_line(aes(colour=symbol))+
  labs(x="Year", 
       y="Value of investment", 
       title = "Growth of a $1000 investment over time") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  theme_minimal()+
  NULL
```

## Scatterplots of individual stocks returns versus S&P500 Index returns.

Besides these exploratory graphs of returns and price evolution, I also need to create scatterplots among the returns of different stocks. `ggpairs` crates a scattterplot matrix that shows the distribution of returns for each stock, and a matrix of scatter plots and correlations. 

```{r correlationMatrix, echo=FALSE}
#calculate daily returns
monthly_capm_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
            spread(key = symbol, value = monthly.returns)  #just keep the period returns grouped by symbol


ggpairs(monthly_capm_returns[-1]) #exclude "Date", the first column, from the correlation matrix

```

The next step is to fit a liner regression model to calculate the $\beta$ of LVMH. After fitting the model, we produce a summary table for the regression model, a 95% confidence interval for the coefficients, and an ANOVA table that shows the split of variability (`Sum Sq`) of LVMH returns and what portion ix explained by the market (`SPY`) versus the unexplained residuals.


```{r AAPL_CAPM, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(monthly_capm_returns, aes(x=SPY, y = LVMHF))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)

lvmh_capm <- lm(LVMHF ~ SPY, data = monthly_capm_returns)
mosaic::msummary(lvmh_capm)

lvmh_capm %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
lvmh_capm %>% broom::glance()

```

>> LVMH has a beta of 0.77 using returns from Jan 1st 2011 to Dec 31st 2017. 35% of it's return are explained by the systematic risk.
